# respiration-monitor
A smart device that can be installed inside a mask for real-time monitoring of COâ‚‚ and respiration patterns of an individual..

## Overview
A respiration monitor is a device meant to be fixed inside a mask to measure and monitor:
- CO<sub>2</sub> concentration
- Respiration patterns
in real time.

This system enables real-time monitoring of a user's breathing behaviour and the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration inside a mask by setting up a small tag inside a mask.
